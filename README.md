# Face-Detection-and-Dual-Camera-Image-Capture-System
This project implements a Face Detection and Dual-Camera Image Capture System designed for real-time image processing and biometric applications. The system utilizes two synchronized camera modules to capture images simultaneously from different angles, enhancing spatial awareness and facial data accuracy. Face detection is performed using computer vision techniques, enabling automatic image capture when a face is detected within the frame. The setup is optimized for reliability and speed, ensuring consistent performance in varying lighting and environmental conditions. This project demonstrates integration of image acquisition, face detection algorithms, and hardware coordination, offering a foundation for applications
